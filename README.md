model = Informers.pipeline("embedding", "Xenova/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1")
query_embedding = model.(query)
doc_embeddings = model.(docs)

model = Informers.pipeline("reranking", "mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-base-v1")
result = model.(query, docs)
```

### Other

You can use the feature extraction pipeline directly.

```ruby
model = Informers.pipeline("feature-extraction", "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", quantized: false)
embeddings = model.(sentences, pooling: "mean", normalize: true)
```

The model files must include `onnx/model.onnx` or `onnx/model_quantized.onnx` ([example](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/tree/main/onnx)).

## Pipelines

Embedding

```ruby
embed = Informers.pipeline("embedding")
embed.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

Reranking (experimental)

```ruby
rerank = Informers.pipeline("reranking")
rerank.("Who created Ruby?", ["Matz created Ruby", "Another doc"])
```

Named-entity recognition

```ruby
ner = Informers.pipeline("ner")
ner.("Ruby is a programming language created by Matz")
```

Sentiment analysis

```ruby
classifier = Informers.pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

Question answering

```ruby
qa = Informers.pipeline("question-answering")
qa.("Who invented Ruby?", "Ruby is a programming language created by Matz")
```

Feature extraction

```ruby
extractor = Informers.pipeline("feature-extraction")
extractor.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

## Credits

This library was ported from [Transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) and is available under the same license.

## Upgrading

### 1.0

Task classes have been replaced with the `pipeline` method.

```ruby
# before
model = Informers::SentimentAnalysis.new("sentiment-analysis.onnx")
model.predict("This is super cool")

# after
model = Informers.pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
model.("This is super cool")
```
