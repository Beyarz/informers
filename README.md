### Other

You can use the feature extraction pipeline directly.

```ruby
model = Informers.pipeline("feature-extraction", "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", quantized: false)
embeddings = model.(sentences, pooling: "mean", normalize: true)
```

The model must include a `.onnx` file ([example](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/tree/main/onnx)). If the file is not at `onnx/model.onnx` or `onnx/model_quantized.onnx`, use the `model_file_name` option to specify the location.

## Pipelines

Embedding

```ruby
embed = Informers.pipeline("embedding")
embed.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

Reranking

```ruby
rerank = Informers.pipeline("reranking")
rerank.("Who created Ruby?", ["Matz created Ruby", "Another doc"])
```

Named-entity recognition

```ruby
ner = Informers.pipeline("ner")
ner.("Ruby is a programming language created by Matz")
```

Sentiment analysis

```ruby
classifier = Informers.pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

Question answering

```ruby
qa = Informers.pipeline("question-answering")
qa.("Who invented Ruby?", "Ruby is a programming language created by Matz")
```

Feature extraction

```ruby
extractor = Informers.pipeline("feature-extraction")
extractor.("We are very happy to show you the ðŸ¤— Transformers library.")
```

Fill mask [unreleased]

```ruby
unmasker = Informers.pipeline("fill-mask")
unmasker.("Paris is the [MASK] of France.")
```

## Credits

This library was ported from [Transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) and is available under the same license.

## Upgrading

### 1.0

Task classes have been replaced with the `pipeline` method.

```ruby
# before
model = Informers::SentimentAnalysis.new("sentiment-analysis.onnx")
model.predict("This is super cool")

# after
model = Informers.pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
model.("This is super cool")
```
